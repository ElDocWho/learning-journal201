#FM Code 201 - Day 1

Today I learned a lot of new things. What HTML is. What Javascript is. How the act together. Different tags for HTML. In Javascript on of the most important thing we did is defining variables.

Among the tags we learned are the new new ones that substitute the tag <div>. Among these tags learned we have <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, <hgroup>, <figure> and <figcaption>.

To define variables we used the code var example = 5; This gave the example variable the value of 5.
