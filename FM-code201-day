#FM Code 201 - Day 2

  Since the last journal entry learned a lot more of how to use Git. Is some
what confusing at the beginning but I am starting to get the hang of it, it is
all about repetition and muscle memory.

  Also learned how to create loops. An example would be as follows:
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      document.write(i);
      }

  Also we covered boxes in CSS. We learned commands to specify the dimension
of a box. Next an example of code that does this using % in CSS.

    p {
      height: 80%;
      width: 80%:
      background-color: #ee3380;
    }

  We also learned what to do with overflowing content.
