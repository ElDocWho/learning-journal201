#Learning Journal 201

**Day 1**

  First day we learned about git and github. Commands like "git init", this
command actually starts git in the directory where we will create our
repository. Another very important command is "git add FILENAME". With this
command the files that we have in the repository can be tracked now by git.

  Another very important command is "commit -m "message"". With this command we
make sure we do not lose any of our work. It is recommended that we execute
this command every 15 minutes.

  We went over the main Unix commands. the CP command is used to copy a file
from one directory to another one. Other commands include rm, which is to erase
files and directories. To erase a directory using this command you have to add \
-rf to force the delete on the directory and all the files inside of it.

  We also learned hot to do branching in github.

**Day 2**
tags like <Header>, <footer>, <nav>, <aside>, <section>, <figure> and <div>. We
also learned about the structure of html.

  In the CSS part we learned hoe to link the CSS file to our HTML file. It is
much better to do it that way than to do a <style> tag. We also learned how to
style web pages using CSS.

**Day 3**

  In this day we covered the box model in CSS. The web page is actually
mad out of elements all made out of boxes. Even if we see an element as a
circle, this element is actually a box. How to manipulate the hight and
width. We also covered the border, margin and padding.

  In the javascript part we covered decision making. This can be done by
 conditionals. One of this conditionals is the If...else statements. Here is an
  example of the if, else statement.

if (x = 0) {
  y = 3 * 9
}
else [
  y = 5 * 20
]

  We also covered loops. Loops keep repeating the same instructions until a
certain condition is met. For the loop we use the for command. Here is an
example of a loop.

for (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
  x = x + 1
}


  In another loop we have instruction performing until a condition changes. In
this loop instead of using the keyword for we use the keyword while. Here is an
example of this loop.

while (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
  x = x + 1
}
