#Learning Journal 201

**Day 1**

  First day we learned about git and github. Commands like "git init", this
command actually starts git in the directory where we will create our
repository. Another very important command is "git add FILENAME". With this
command the files that we have in the repository can be tracked now by git.

  Another very important command is "commit -m "message"". With this command we
make sure we do not lose any of our work. It is recommended that we execute
this command every 15 minutes.

  We went over the main Unix commands. the CP command is used to copy a file
from one directory to another one. Other commands include rm, which is to erase
files and directories. To erase a directory using this command you have to add \
-rf to force the delete on the directory and all the files inside of it.

  We also learned hot to do branching in github.
