#FM Code 201 - Day 3

  In day 3 I have made good progress in Git. Everything wit git is about muscle
memory and practice to get it right. I learned a few commands that helped me
with creating branches and enabling files to be tracked.  Learned new commands.
are some examples of the commands learned:

    git checkout -d test

With this command you create a branch named test and switch to that branch.

    git add app.js

With this command we enable the file app.js to be tracked by git.

    We also learned how to make loops. Loops help us execute a command until
the conditional is satisfied.

  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
  }

  We covered in CSS how to change the appearance of the boxes used in HTML.
Here is an example of the code used to change the with and height of a box.
We can give values to the with and height of boxes using percentage and by
pixels. Here is an example of changing the box with and height using percentage
values.

p {
  height 80%
  width 80%
}
